How to operate the app

Databases must be created in the correct order in order to avoid errors. Firstly you will need to create Consultations and Customers, then add Vets then add Pets.

To read all rows in the table you can go to the relevant /index page to see everything that has been created. To view individual rows you can click show to bring up more detailed information

Once in the individual items show you can edit, update and delete.

Currently customers can have many pets and vets can have many consultations
